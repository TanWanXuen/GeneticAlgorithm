# GeneticAlgorithm
### Solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) By Genetic Algorithm
By using Python, various aspects of the GA, including population initialization, parent selection methods, survival selection, crossover, and mutation are explored. Additionally, the performance of different parent selection methods (Random Selection, Tournament Selection, and Proportional Selection) is evaluated and compared.
